This project involved me creating a Spring Framework Java back-end for a travel agency that needed to migrate their back-end to a maintanaibale and scalable framework. As part of the task, I was assigned to develop the back-end system using Spring and Java, while integrating it with an existing Angular front-end and MySQL database. Throughout this project, I had to build and configure the system, by setting up the Java project, creating necessary packages like controllers, entities, dao, and services. I also wrote code to handle customer orders, vacation packages, and other related data (order number, etc.). I also had to implement RESTful API's and had to ensure that the front-end and back-end communicated appropriately, to present data appropriately. I used Spring framework modules like Spring Data JPA to manage database operations.

Message me for access to the front-end.
